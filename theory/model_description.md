Model Description

This project studies the phenomenology of a Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) scalar extension implemented in MadGraph.

Theoretical Framework

The analysis is based on:

Quantum Field Theory

Perturbative scattering amplitudes

Effective interactions

Tree-level Monte Carlo event generation

The model introduces an extended scalar sector modifying Higgs phenomenology through additional interaction terms.

Physical Observables

The study focuses on:

Production cross sections

Differential distributions

Dependence on coupling parameters

Comparison with Standard Model expectations

All numerical simulations are performed using Monte Carlo integration techniques.
